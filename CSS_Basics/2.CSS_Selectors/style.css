    There are many different ways we can select elements in css to write rules.
    When using multiple selector methods,

    Some css properties are inherited from a parent element while others are not.

    Let's style our footer because we can! It also gives us an opportunity to talk about inheritance.
    If we try to set the background and color of the footer; it looks like only the color changes!
    The background does not change.

    This is because we are applying styling to a parent element here...the footer.
    What we actually see is the child element...the paragraph.
    Certain css properties are inherited from a parent while others are not.
    In this example, the color property is inherited from a parent.  The background property is not.
