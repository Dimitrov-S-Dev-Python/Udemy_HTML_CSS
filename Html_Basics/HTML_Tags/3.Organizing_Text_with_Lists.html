!--
    The list tag allows us to group a set of related items.
    There are unordered lists using the <ul></ul> tag and ordered lists using the <ol></ol> tag.
    Each type of list holds list items indicated by using the <li></li> tag.
-->


<!--
    An unordered list <ul></ul> are not numbered and presented with bullets.
    Each list must contain list items <li></li>
-->


<!--
    An ordered list <ol></ol> is a numbered list where the sequence is important.
    Each list must contain list items <li></li>
-->


<!--
    You can also nest different lists inside each other.
    These can be a combination of ordered and unordered lists.
