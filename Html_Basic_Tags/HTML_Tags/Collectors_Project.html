<!--
    The Collectors Project
    This project will build multiple linked pages for something that is a collection.
    The collection should have multiple items in it where you can devote a single page
    to a given item in the collection.
-->

<!--
    Your index page should have the following:
        A 'header' or title section/title banner at the top of your page.
        A login form with required username, password, submit, and reset buttons.
        When hitting submit you should be directed to the main.html page.
