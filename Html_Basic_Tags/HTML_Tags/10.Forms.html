    The form tag <form><\form> is a great way to hold and organize different types of input elements.
    It essentially serves as a 'CONTAINER' for all of these elements to sit inside.
    When you place a button inside a form, we can use that button to submit all the input data in the form or reset data in the form.

<h1>Working with Forms!</h1>


<!--
    We can use labels for all inputs by giving them an id just like we did with radio buttons.
    We should also give each input an id and name like the radio buttons.
    This will help later in the course when we try to process the form data using javascript.
    The value we do not need to set as the user will set the value via their input!
    We can make the inputs required and set min and max lengths.

    We can specify our button types as submit or reset.
    The default button type is submit, but it is good practice to declare it.
    Reset will clear the attached form of all data.

    Forms_Part_1 have an action attribute that specify where to send all the collected data
    When the form is submitted.  We can send to another website or a page in our directory.
    Each piece of data will have a name and a value.

    Let's create another html file called 10.page1.html for this example.
-->
<h2>Here is our input fields/buttons inside a form</h2>
<form action="10.page1.html">
    <label for="username">Enter a Username: </label>
    <input type="text" id="username" name="my_username" placeholder="Enter Username" required>

    <label for="password">Enter a Password</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="my_password"placeholder="Enter a Password" required minlength="4"maxlength="8">

    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    <button type="reset">Clear Form</button>
</form>
<!--
    We were actually sending our data in the example above, but we don't know how to process it.
    Note that the username and password are in the URL above when we hit submit!
    We can send our data to websites that do know how to process it!
    We just have to make sure that we follow their naming conventions for the data that is passed.

<h3>Search Google</h3>
<form action="https://google.com/search">
    <label for="search_item">Search Google:</label>
    <input type="text" id="search_item" name="q" required>
    <button type="submit">Search Google</button>
    <button type="reset">Reset</button>
