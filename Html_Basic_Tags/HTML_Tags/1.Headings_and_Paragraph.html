    A tag is a piece of information that describes the data that it is assigned to.
    Tags are specified using angled brackets <>.
    Most tags have an opening tag <> and closing tag </>.
    However, some tags are self-closing and only require the opening tag.
    Some common tags include heading, paragraph, images, lists, and dividers.

<!-- Plain text -->


<!--
    We can 'mark up' text using various tags.
    Heading tags are used to add titles to sections.
    HTML defines six levels of headings h1 through h6.
    h1 the largest and boldest text, h6 smallest and least bold.
    You should only have ONE h1 tag per page!
-->

<h1>This is an h1 heading. It is the LARGEST AND BOLDEST.</h1>
<h2>This is an h2 heading. It is still big.</h2>
<h3>This is an h3 heading. It is getting smaller.</h3>
<h4>This is an h4 heading. It is even smaller.</h4>
<h5>This is an h5 heading. It is tiny.</h5>
<h6>This is an h6 heading. It is very tiny.</h6>
<!--
    We can group text using a paragraph tag.
    Paragraphs are used to add sections of text.
    Browsers automatically add a single blank line before and after each paragraph tag.
    However, inside a paragraph tag, whitespace is not accounted for (such as tabs or enter)

<h1>Hello World! Paragraph Incoming.</h1>
<p>
    We can put a lot of text that should be grouped together inside a paragraph tag.
    However, paragraphs DO NOT register whitespace such as tab or enter!
    I just hit enter in my IDE, but it will not appear in the browser.
    I will now hit the tab              Do you see the tab space? Of course not!

    Here is a second paragraph. By adding a second paragraph, we should have a blank line
    between our two paragraphs!
    Because browsers automatically add a blank line before and after the p tag.
