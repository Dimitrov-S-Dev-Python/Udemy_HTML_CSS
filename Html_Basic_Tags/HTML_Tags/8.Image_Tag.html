<!--
    The image tag is a self-closing tag <img>...it doesn't need a closing tag!
    The image tag has an attribute you must set - src; the source of the image.
    This can be in our local directory (folder) or from the internet.

<h2>Here is the image of the moon!</h2>
<img src="8.moon.jpg">
<hr>



<!--
    This image is way too big for my liking, so we can resize it with the style attribute.
    We'll use pixels, px to resize.  A pixel is the smallest unit a screen can display.
    We'll learn more about pixels when we discuss css.
-->
<h2>Here is the moon resized</h2>
<img src="8.moon.jpg"style="width: 200px;height: 200px">

<!--
    Changing the width and height of the picture can throw off the aspect ratio of the picture.
-->
<h2>Here is the moon resized with the aspect ratio intact</h2>
<img src="8.moon.jpg"style="width: 200px">


<!--
    Changing just the width will keep the aspect ratio of the picture and auto adjust the height.
-->

<!--
    It is always good practice to add an alt attribute to your images.
    This is a text representation of what the picture is showing.
    In case someone is visually impaired or if your image doesn't load,
    you can still convey meaning with the alternative text.
-->

<h2>Here is a image that will not load</h2>
<img src="not_load.jpg" alt="description if not load">


<!-- We can use images as links! -->
<h2>Here the moon is used as a link</h2>
<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/moon" target="_blank">
    <img src="8.blood_moon.jpg" alt="moon link to NASA" style="width: 200px;">
</a>
<!--
    We can even add images from other sites.
    In Google Chrome, right-click an image and select 'copy image address'.
    Then paste that address as your src attribute.
    Be careful though of copyright!
-->
<h2>Here is an image from an outside website</h2>
