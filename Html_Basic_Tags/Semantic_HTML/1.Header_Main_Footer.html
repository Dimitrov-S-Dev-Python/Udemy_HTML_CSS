    Many html tags naturally convey meaning to the user/reader.
    For example a <p> tag tells us that we have a paragraph of text,
    a <h1> tag tells us we have a heading, and a <blockquote> tag tells us we have a quote.

    On the other hand, there are many html tags that convey no meaning at all
    for what they hold.  A primary example of this is our containers, <div> and <span>.
    Their names do not tell us anything about what is inside them!

    There are many useful and optional semantic html tags that allow us to give extra
    meaning to our tags rather than just throwing all of our content into
    arbitrary divs and spans.

    In fact...we've sort of been exposed to this idea as we gave all our divs id/class names.
    Semantic html makes our html more legible and easy to understand; for us and anyone else
    Semantic html makes our html more accessible to others.
    Semantic html makes our html have better results for search engines.
