    An inline element does not start on a new line.
    They will be placed on the same line as the previous element.
    They will only take up as much horizontal width as is needed.
    They will only take up as much vertical height as needed.
    A nice way to show this is by adding a background color via the style attribute.

    *Some elements are not ENTIRELY inline...but for now we will simply say they are.*
