<!--
    A block-level element ALWAYS starts on a new line.
    It takes up the full horizontal width of its container (what it is inside).
    It takes up only as much vertical height as needed to fit the contents of the element.
    A nice way to show this is by adding a background color via the style attribute.
-->


        <!--
            Headings are block level elements.
            Each time we make a new heading they are on a new line.
            They take up the full width of their parent container (the screen).
            The height will only be as tall as needed to fit the content.
        -->


        <!-- Paragraphs are block level elements. -->


        <!-- Lists and list items are block level elements. -->


        <!--
            Forms are block level elements.
            However, the label, input fields and buttons inside the form are NOT!
            Note how the label, input field, and button are NOT on new lines
            And only take up as much space as required!
