<!--
    The div (divider or container) tag <div></div> can be used to group content together.
    This is POWERFUL as it can be used to define a section of html elements.
    We can give a div that is holding element an id or class attribute.
    Later we can target the entire div to style specific sections of content on our website.

        <!--
            Divs are block level elements.
            This means they will take up as much horizontal width as they can.
            They will also always be on new lines.
            We can wrap inline elements inside a div to place them on a new line.
            There are BETTER ways to do this but for now, this is good to show off divs.

        <!-- Recall images are inline(ish) elements, so they will be placed on the same line by default. -->

  <img src="3.Cat.jpg" alt="Cat" width="25%">

        <!--
            We can wrap the images in a div to put them on new lines!
            Since these divs are NOT unique we can't give them an id, but should give a class.
