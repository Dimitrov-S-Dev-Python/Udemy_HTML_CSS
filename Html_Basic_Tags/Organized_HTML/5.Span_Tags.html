<!--
    If a div is a block level container, the span tag <span></span> is an inline container.
    Spans are powerful because we can give them a class or id attribute which we can
    later target using css to style specific sections of our website.
    Imagine we wanted to format a section of text in a paragraph with a given background color...
-->

  <h1>Spans - An Inline Element Container</h1>

        <!-- We could try to style the whole paragraph...wrong. -->
  <p style="background: lightgreen">
    Maybe I want to style THIS SECTION A SPECIFIC WAY!
    If I style the whole paragraph, the WHOLE paragraph will be stiled the same.
    Which is not the desired result!
  </p>

        <!-- We could try to create a div around the section of text...wrong. -->

 <p>
    Maybe I want to style
    <div class="text_wrapper_div" style="background: lightgreen">THIS SECTION A SPECIFIC WAY!</div>
    If I use a div to target that section it places the section on a new line
    and takes up the whole of the screen since div is a block level element.
    This is not what we want!
  </p>
        <!-- We could use a span (inline container) to wrap the text...correct! -->
<p>
    Maybe I want to style
    <span class="text_wrapper_span" style="background: lightgreen">THIS SECTION A SPECIFIC WAY!</span>
    To do this, I just have to wrap the text in a span.
