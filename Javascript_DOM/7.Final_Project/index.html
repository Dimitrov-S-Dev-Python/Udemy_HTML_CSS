<!--
    In our final project you are to build a fully funcitonal html/css/js site.
    Choose whatever site focus you want!  I chose a t-shirt company...because why not!?!

    You should use all of your previous HTML and CSS knowledge to layout and design the content of your pages.
    
    You should have a minimum of 3 interactive javascript 'tools' on the site that do some backend coding.
    I have multiple js files; one for each 'tool'.
    For example, my site has the following pages that use js to accomplish some task:
        - A design page which 'designs' a t-shirt based on various user input fields.
        - A price calculator page that determines how much and order would cost based on quantity and size of shirts.
        - A size calculator page that determines the size of shirt a user should order based on height and weight.
        - A contact page that collects when and how a user would like to be contacted and verifies the information. 

    I hope you have enjoyed taking this course and that this is a fun and challenging way to end!!!
    Good luck!
